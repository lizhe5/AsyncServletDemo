<!-- Note: Snow takes all request to provide full customizability,
     performance impact is negligeable, and flexibility (including performance
     optimization) is maximized. So, at the end, this approach will boost 
     your application performance significantly without having to learn tomcat or other container proprietary optimization tricks -->
